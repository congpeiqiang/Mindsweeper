LangChain helps developers build applications powered by LLMs through a standard interface for models, embeddings, vector stores, and more. Quickly build and iterate on LLM applications with LangChain's modular, component-based architecture. While the LangChain framework can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools when building LLM applications. To improve your LLM application development, pair LangChain with:. * Integrations – List of LangChain integrations, including chat & embedding models, tools & toolkits, and more. * API Reference – Detailed reference on navigating base packages and integrations for LangChain. * Contributing Guide – Learn how to contribute to LangChain projects and find good first issues. python   open-source   enterprise   framework   ai   gemini   openai   multiagent   agents   ai-agents   rag   pydantic   llm   generative-ai   chatgpt   langchain   anthropic   langgraph   deepagents.', 'raw_content': None, 'score': 0.88822687,

    {'content': 'Available in both Python- and Javascript-based libraries, LangChain’s tools and APIs simplify the process of building LLM-driven applications like chatbots and AI agents. Likewise, you can use the IBM watsonx APIs and Python SDK, which includes a LangChain integration, to build applications in LangChain with models that you’ve already trained or fine-tuned for your specific needs using the *WatsonxLLM* class (and that model’s specific project ID). Another LangChain class for building AI agents with the integration of tool calling and chaining with watsonx.ai models is *ChatWatsonx*. AI Applications made with LangChain provide great utility for a variety of use cases, from straightforward question-answering and text generation tasks to more complex solutions that use an LLM as a “reasoning engine.”. Chatbots are among the most intuitive uses of LLMs. LangChain can be used to provide proper context for the specific use of a chatbot, and to integrate chatbots into existing communication channels and workflows with their own APIs. Language models can be tasked with summarizing many types of text, from breaking down complex academic articles and transcripts to providing a digest of incoming emails.', 'raw_content': None, 'score': 0.84707206,
